# Problem Solution 
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    print(f'{a + b}\n{a-b}\n{a*b}')
```

## Problem Solution Explanation
The given Python script performs simple arithmetic operations on two numbers inputted by the user.

```if __name__ == '__main__':``` : This line checks if the script is being run directly as the main program.

```a = int(input())``` : This line prompts the user to input a value, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable a.

```b = int(input())``` : This line prompts the user to input another value, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable b.

```print(f'{a + b}\n{a-b}\n{a*b}')``` : This line calculates and prints the sum, difference, and product of the two inputted numbers, separated by newline characters.
