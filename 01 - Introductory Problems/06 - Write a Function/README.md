# Problem Solution 
```
def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0:
                leap = True
            else:
                leap = False
        else:
            leap = True
    else:
        leap = False
    return leap
```

## Problem Solution Explanation
The given Python function is_leap determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

```leap = False``` : This initializes a boolean variable leap to False. This variable will be used to store whether the year is a leap year (True) or not (False).

```if year % 4 == 0:``` : A year must be divisible by 4 to be a leap year. If the year is not divisible by 4, it cannot be a leap year.

```if year % 100 == 0:``` : If the year is divisible by 4, the next check is to see if it is divisible by 100. If it is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.

```if year % 400 == 0:``` : If the year is divisible by 100, the next check is to see if it is also divisible by 400. If it is divisible by 400, it is a leap year; otherwise, it is not.

```return leap``` : The function returns the value of leap, indicating whether the given year is a leap year (True) or not (False).

## Leap Year Rules
  A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
  - **Examples** :
    
      *is_leap(2000)*: Returns True because 2000 is divisible by 400.
    
      *is_leap(1900)*: Returns False because 1900 is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
    
      *is_leap(2012)*: Returns True because 2012 is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
    
      *is_leap(2019)*: Returns False because 2019 is not divisible by 4.
