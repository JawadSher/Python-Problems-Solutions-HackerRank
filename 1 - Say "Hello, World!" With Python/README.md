# Problem Solution 
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Hello, World!")

```

## Code Explanation
The provided code is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Hereâ€™s what each part of the code does:
``` if __name__ == '__main__'::```

This line checks whether the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module in another script).
In Python, the ```__name__``` variable is set to ```"__main__"``` when the script is executed directly.
This ensures that the code block inside the if statement only runs if the script is being executed directly.
```print("Hello, World!")``` :

This line prints the string ```"Hello, World!"``` to the console.
